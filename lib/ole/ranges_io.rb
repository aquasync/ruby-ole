# = Introduction
#
# +RangesIO+ is a basic class for wrapping another IO object allowing you to arbitrarily reorder
# slices of the input file by providing a list of ranges. Intended as an initial measure to curb
# inefficiencies in the Dirent#data method just reading all of a file's data in one hit, with
# no method to stream it.
# 
# This class will encapuslate the ranges (corresponding to big or small blocks) of any ole file
# and thus allow reading/writing directly to the source bytes, in a streamed fashion (so just
# getting 16 bytes doesn't read the whole thing).
#
# In the simplest case it can be used with a single range to provide a limited io to a section of
# a file.
#
# = Limitations
#
# * No buffering. by design at the moment. Intended for large reads
# 
# = TODO
# 
# On further reflection, this class is something of a joining/optimization of
# two separate IO classes. a SubfileIO, for providing access to a range within
# a File as a separate IO object, and a ConcatIO, allowing the presentation of
# a bunch of io objects as a single unified whole.
# 
# I will need such a ConcatIO if I'm to provide Mime#to_io, a method that will
# convert a whole mime message into an IO stream, that can be read from.
# It will just be the concatenation of a series of IO objects, corresponding to
# headers and boundaries, as StringIO's, and SubfileIO objects, coming from the
# original message proper, or RangesIO as provided by the Attachment#data, that
# will then get wrapped by Mime in a Base64IO or similar, to get encoded on-the-
# fly. Thus the attachment, in its plain or encoded form, and the message as a
# whole never exists as a single string in memory, as it does now. This is a
# fair bit of work to achieve, but generally useful I believe.
# 
# This class isn't ole specific, maybe move it to my general ruby stream project.
